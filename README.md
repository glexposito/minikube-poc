# minikube-poc

This repository is a proof-of-concept (PoC) for running Minikube with two different APIs: one built in C# and one in Rust.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to orchestrate and run microservices written in C# and Rust using Minikube and Kubernetes.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - C#
  - Rust
  - Shell scripts
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes (Minikube)

## Structure

- `NodeId.Api/` — C# API source code
- `node_id_api/` — Rust API source code
- Deployment scripts and Kubernetes manifests for both APIs
- Dockerfiles for building containers
- Test projects and solution files

## Getting Started

This PoC is designed to help you explore how to deploy and manage multiple APIs in different languages on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

## How to use it

Coming soon...
